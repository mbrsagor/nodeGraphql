# node-graphql
> Student management system backend GraphQL server.

The following steps will walk you thru installation on a Mac. Linux should be similar.
It's also possible to develop on a Windows machine, but I have not documented the steps.
If you've developed the `node-graphQl` app run on Windows, you should have little problem getting
up and running.


## Setup
- NPM stable version
- Node stable version
- Docker (If you want ot run the project docker container)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbrsagor/nodeGraphql.git
cd nodeGraphql
npm install
npm start
```
